                As a composer I have always felt the need to express myself creativly. I love the idea of being able to create something from scratch which is why 
                I studied music composition at Baldwin Wallace University. Coming out of University I accepted a job as a Sales Development representative. I chose 
                this path to push myself out of my comfort zone and learn new skills.

                I started learning how to code on the side my senior year of university. I was intrigued by the freedom to build useful applications right at my desk. 
                From then on I knew that eventually I would be in the technology space. Approaching from a creative background I was surprised about how similar programming 
                was to writing music. There is structure, form, and everyone has a different way of doing it.
                </p>

                <p>
                Coming out of the Georgia Tech Bootcamp I am looking for a career in web development. This has been my goal for the last year and drove me to learn how to code 
                on the side and eventually commit to an organized program to learn more. Being in tech has always been a dream of mine as I strive to be the best developer that I can be.
                I am excited at the prospect of doing this as my career and won't stop until I get there.
