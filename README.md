# Portfolio Project


## User Story

### AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Project Description

For this project I was tasked with creating my own website that included information about me, my work and contact information.
The content had to be organized in a way that makes sense, and is to be accessed via the navigation bar. I included a short biography
about myself and my future endeavors. Below that I had to include some images representing coding projects that I have done or planning on
accomplishing. Finally a I created a footer with some contact information. This project shows my web development capabilities so far and 
was intended to push me out of my comfort zone.
